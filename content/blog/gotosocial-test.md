Hello World ðŸ‘‹

I recently got the opportunity to try out [GoToSocial](https://gotosocial.org/) thanks to [Benjamin Hollon](https://fosstodon.org/@benjaminhollon), who spun up an [instance](https://gotosocial.verboseguacamole.com/) purely for testing. I was offered an account which has to be manually created in the database (there is no web frontend for this). The whole process of account setup took about 2-3 minutes, from memory, possibly less, which is much less painless than Mastodon and Pixelfed both of which mostly require the instance admin accepting your request. 

Before we go any further, I am going to explain what GoToSocial is. To quote their [website](https://gotosocial.org/):
> GoToSocial is an ActivityPub social network server, written in Golang.
> GoToSocial provides a lightweight, customizable, and safety-focused entryway into the Fediverse.
> With GoToSocial, you can keep in touch with your friends, post, read, and share images and articles. All without being tracked or advertised to!
> If you've ever used something like Twitter or Tumblr (or even Myspace!) GoToSocial will probably feel familiar to you.
> You can follow people and have followers, you make posts which people can favourite and reply to and share, and you scroll through posts from people you follow using a timeline.
> You can write long posts or short posts, or just post images, it's up to you.
> You can also, of course, block people or otherwise limit interactions that you don't want by posting just to your friends.
> GoToSocial is not designed for 'must-follow' influencers with tens of thousands of followers, and it's not designed to be addictive.
> Your timeline and your experience are shaped by who you follow and how you interact with people, not by metrics of engagement!
