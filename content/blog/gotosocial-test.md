Hello World ðŸ‘‹

I recently got the opportunity to try out [GoToSocial](https://gotosocial.org/) thanks to [Benjamin Hollon](https://fosstodon.org/@benjaminhollon), who spun up an [instance](https://gotosocial.verboseguacamole.com/) purely for testing. I was offered an account which has to be manually created in the database (there is no web frontend for this). The whole process of account setup took about 2-3 minutes, from memory, possibly less, which is much less painless than Mastodon and Pixelfed both of which mostly require the instance admin accepting your request.
