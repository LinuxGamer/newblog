Hello World! Today I'm going to be explaining an amazing project, that allows users to create a built package for others to easily install on Fedora and other RHEL based Linux distributions.

Fedora has had it's flaws over the last few years, like the issues surrounding the codec removals, but there is **one** thing they do really well; and that is their automated build system providing a package repository as its output, called [COPR](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/). COPR (Cool Other Package Repo) is a project maintained by Fedora to make building and managing third party package repositories easier. COPR, to me, is an interesting concept and works in a very similar way (almost the same) to the AUR; a user repository.
