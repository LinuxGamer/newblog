# Introduction
There are so many flight simulators available; from big professional sims like Microsoft Flight Simulator and X-Plane, to Free and Open Source sims like Flightgear. There is so much choice and there are many different points to consider when choosing your flight simulator. The overall experience of FlightGear is much easier than other sims, it's only a few clicks before you're all setup and ready to go sky high.

FlightGear has a wide variety of aircraft, from propeller fixed wings, airliners and fighter jets, to helicopters and even cars and motorbikes. This wide choice is one of the reasons that I choose it over other flight sims. I've been able to fly all my favourite aircraft, from the historical Avro Lancaster and Spitfire, to more modern Folland Gnat, BAE Hawk T2 and Eurofighter Typhoon, as well as many helicopters, ranging from the small Hughes MD500e, to the Eurocopter EC135 and EC145.
